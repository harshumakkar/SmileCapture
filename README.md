# SmileCapture
Computer Vision Code to capture image when it detects a smiling face.

The Python Code works on HaarClassifiers to detect a human face first. Then we use that to set a boundary around the face , one a region is made the region is converted into gray scale , as CV understands gray better ( we convert Colors ).
Once this is done, we start by detecting the Smile on the boundary(face).
A smile is detected and the image is captured after displaying a message on screen .
